# SimLangTypeChecker

Program Overview

The program is designed to lexically analyze, parse, type-check, and execute code written in a custom programming language called SimLang. This process involves several steps: lexical analysis, syntactic analysis (parsing), semantic analysis (type checking), and execution. The program uses the PLY library for lexical and syntactic analysis.
